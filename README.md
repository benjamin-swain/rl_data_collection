This is a Bakkes Mod plugin which, when built as a dll, is used to automatically collect and upload Rocket League game data which can be used to train a neural network. The dll is made available in another repository: https://github.com/opalr/nn_data_plugin (this repo also shows what type of data is available).

I have not tested this in a few years so there may be issues. If you would like to test it and leave an issue showing the error, I will fix it. Otherwise, I'll be able to test/fix it myself in a few weeks when I'm back in the office.
